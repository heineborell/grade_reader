# OMR and Handwriting detection 
This repos aim is to use opencv and deep learning stuff to get a student id from optical mark and then get the handwritten grade from instructor.
Then the extracted info will be pushed to excel sheet. A totally unnecessary thing according to xkcd but there should be another axis for the hate of the work you need to do. And I hate dealing wit excel.
